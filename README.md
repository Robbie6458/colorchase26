# Color Chase

A daily color palette guessing game built with Next.js and React. Guess the hidden 5-color palette in 5 tries, collect palettes daily, and build your personal collection.

## 🎮 How to Play

Color Chase is inspired by Wordle, but with color instead of words. Each day you get a new palette to guess:

1. **Start with a blank palette** - You have 5 attempts to guess today's 5-color palette
2. **Click colors on the color wheel** - Select colors and click to place them in your guessing row
3. **Get visual feedback**:
   - 🟢 **Green border** = Right color in the right position
   - 🟠 **Orange border** = Right color in the wrong position  
   - ✕ **X mark** = Color not in today's palette
4. **Solve it or learn tomorrow** - Win and collect the palette, or lose and see the correct answer
5. **Build your collection** - Every palette you guess (win or lose) is saved to your collection

### Example Gameplay
- The hidden palette today might be: `#FF6B35 #004E89 #1FA8AC #F5A623 #9B59B6`
- You guess: `#FF6B35 #F5A623 #1FA8AC #004E89 #FFFFFF`
  - Position 1: Green (correct!)
  - Position 2: Orange (right color, wrong spot)
  - Position 3: Green (correct!)
  - Position 4: Green (correct!)
  - Position 5: X (not in palette)
- Adjust and try again!

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: [Next.js 16.0.8](https://nextjs.org) - React with server-side rendering and static generation
- **Language**: [TypeScript 5](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com) - Utility-first CSS framework
- **React**: [19.2.1](https://react.dev) - UI library with hooks
- **Icons**: [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons) - Google's icon library via Google Fonts
- **State Management**: React hooks (`useState`, `useContext`, `useEffect`)
- **Storage**: Browser `localStorage` for palette collection persistence

## 🎨 Color Palette Generation

Palettes are generated using seeded randomization to ensure consistency across all players:

- **Date Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD` in Pacific time (reset at 9 AM)
- **Palette Families**: 12 themed color categories with HSL-based generation
- **Generation**: The server salts the date with its private service key and stores the result in Supabase
- **Variations**: Each palette uses tone treatments (tint, tone, shade, vivid) for visual diversity

The browser receives the wheel and saved guesses. A signed, HttpOnly cookie tracks
the round; `/api/guess` checks rows on the server and reveals the ordered answer
after the fifth guess or a win. `/api/social-palette` exposes the five colors in
alphabetical order after 10 AM Pacific for the Instagram workflow. Apply
`supabase/migrations/protect_daily_answers.sql` before deploying the app so the
Supabase REST API cannot reveal the answer directly.

## 📱 Game States

- **Playing** - Guessing the palette with feedback
- **Won** - Successfully matched all 5 colors in 5 or fewer tries
- **Lost** - Used all 5 tries without solving (solution revealed)
- **Info Overlay** - Accessible game rules and explanation
- **Stats Overlay** - Personal performance statistics (planned feature)

## 🔮 Future Features

- User authentication with Google & email
- Persistent user profiles to save collection across devices
- Social sharing of puzzle results
- Leaderboards & achievements
- Daily statistics dashboard
- Custom color wheel themes

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run ESLint to check code quality
